## What I do

Apply clean-code practice — naming, small functions (<10 lines), single responsibility, self-documenting code — and enforce this project's codified learnings below. House rules take precedence over textbook practice.

## When to use me

- Writing or reviewing code for readability and maintainability
- Refactoring legacy code; vague, inconsistent, or misleading names; long multi-purpose functions

> Textbook content (naming priority order, Object Calisthenics with code examples, formatting, steps, checklists) removed 2026-09 — the model already knows it; this file carries only house-specific rules. All 10 learnings preserved verbatim (rule + detection); illustrative code blocks dropped.

## House Learnings

### Learning: `method-name-reuse-different-semantics`
A method name reused across classes with DIFFERENT semantics violates the principle of least surprise — the reader assumes one meaning, the code does another. Before naming a method, grep the codebase for the proposed name; if it exists elsewhere, verify the semantic contract is IDENTICAL or qualify the name with the specific condition (`process_for_refund`, `build_draft`).
Detection: `rg 'def (\w+)\(self' --type py -o --no-filename | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30`

#### Learning: `duplicate-service-account-check`
Never call the same expensive method twice in one function — extract to a local variable. Single call, clear intent, no redundant work.

### Learning: `two-phase-dataclass-initialization`
Every function must return a COMPLETE object. If a field cannot be computed at construction time, make it `Optional[None]` so the type system surfaces the incompleteness — sentinel defaults (`0.0`, `None`, `""`) plus a companion `compute_*`/`populate_*` call are silently wrong when the second call is forgotten.
Detection: functions returning hardcoded defaults that have companion `compute_*`/`populate_*` methods.

### Learning: `parallel-hierarchies-for-report-type-variants`
Two container+hook+component trees that are >70% identical for different report types are a duplication smell — every bug fix must be applied twice and drifts silently on the second pass. Extract a single parameterized tree driven by a type discriminator + config object (`REPORT_CONFIG: Record<ReportType, …>`).
Detection: sibling feature folders with matching `use*Report` hooks; structural diff (difftastic) on the pair.

### Learning: `self-documented-duplication`
"Could be replaced by X" / "should extract this" comments are permanent confessions — the follow-up ticket is never filed and the duplication ships as if deliberate. File a ticket and reference it in the comment (`# See PROJ-1234`), or eliminate the duplication now.
Detection: `rg "could be replaced|should be extracted|tracked as follow-up|TODO.*extract|FIXME.*duplicate"`

### Learning: `brittle-single-strategy-data-extraction`
A hardcoded single extraction path silently returns `null` when it fails — the caller never knows why. Implement ordered fallback strategies and raise a descriptive error (include status + body excerpt) when all strategies fail.

### Learning: `inline-imports-in-functions`
Imports inside function bodies hide the module's true dependencies from static analysis (mypy, IDE) and mask circular-import problems — fix the architecture (split the module, extract an interface) and import at module level. Exception: genuinely conditional heavy dependencies behind feature flags (`import torch` only when GPU inference is requested).
Detection: `rg "^\s+(import|from)\s" --type py`

### Learning: `broad-except-masks-bugs`
Broad `except Exception` masks programming bugs (`KeyError`, `AttributeError`, `TypeError`) as service outages. Catch expected transport errors narrowly (`ConnectError`, `TimeoutException`, `HTTPStatusError`); let bugs propagate as 500s so monitoring surfaces them.
Detection: `rg 'except Exception\b|except:' --type py -l`

### Learning: `silent-failure-sequential-async`
A critical async operation that catches its own failure and only logs (`logger.error` / `console.error`) prevents the caller from detecting it — the caller continues on stale data in an inconsistent state. Either throw and let the caller decide whether to degrade, or return a discriminated union (`Result[T, E]`).
Detection: functions whose except/catch handler only calls a logger.

### Learning: `scattered-z-index-magic-numbers`
Z-index values MUST be centralized (CSS custom properties or a TypeScript constants file). Hardcoded values drift across files and create layering races that are nearly impossible to debug after the fact.
Detection: `rg 'z-index:\s*\d+' --type css --type tsx -c`

## Iteration Protocol (opt-in)

Only under `AUTORESEARCH_PROTOCOL=1`: bounded iterations (default 10); safety blocks `.env`, `node_modules/`, `rm -rf`, `git push --force`. See `autoresearch-core-skill`.
