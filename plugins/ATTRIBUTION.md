## vibeguard (`opencode-vibeguard`)

`plugins/vibeguard.ts` is a single-file OpenCode **v2** port of
[opencode-vibeguard](https://github.com/inkdust2021/opencode-vibeguard) v0.1.0 by inkdust2021.

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/inkdust2021/opencode-vibeguard (npm: `opencode-vibeguard@0.1.0`)
- **License:** MIT (see full text below)
- **What was ported:** the redaction engine, pattern set (incl. builtins), placeholder
  session (HMAC-SHA256 `__VG_<CATEGORY>_<hash12>__` placeholders, TTL + eviction),
  deep object walk, and restore logic — essentially verbatim from upstream
  `src/{config,engine,session,deep,restore,patterns}.js`.
- **What changed:** the plugin entrypoint was rewritten for the v2 plugin API
  (`ctx.session.hook("context"|"generate")` for outbound masking,
  `ctx.tool.hook("execute.before")` for tool-input restore). Config discovery,
  placeholder format, and fail-open-when-disabled semantics are unchanged, so
  existing `vibeguard.config.json` files work as-is.
- **Why a local port:** V1 plugin implementations do not run on OpenCode v2 and
  upstream has no v2 release. The npm pin was removed from the `plugins` array
  (double-registration guard) in favor of this vendored port.

## ponytail (`@dietrichgebert/ponytail`)

This directory (`plugins/ponytail/`) contains code vendored and adapted from the
[ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) project by Dietrich Gebert.

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
- **Pinned version:** v4.8.4 (tag `v4.8.4`)
- **License:** MIT (see full text below)
- **Files vendored:**
  - `SKILL.md` — the ponytail ruleset (copied verbatim from `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md`)
  - `instructions.cjs` — adapted from `hooks/ponytail-instructions.js` and
    `hooks/ponytail-config.js` (mode-filtering logic preserved; Claude-Code-specific
    config-file paths dropped; reads the co-located `SKILL.md`)
  - `../skills/ponytail-audit-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from
    `skills/ponytail-audit/SKILL.md` (house frontmatter; sibling/command refs renamed)
  - `../skills/ponytail-review-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from
    `skills/ponytail-review/SKILL.md` (house frontmatter; sibling/command refs renamed)
  - `../skills/ponytail-debt-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from
    `skills/ponytail-debt/SKILL.md` (house frontmatter; sibling/command refs renamed)
  - Upstream satellite command wrappers (`.opencode/command/*.md`) NOT vendored —
    the scoped plugin owns the `/ponytail*` command namespace.
- **Adaptation rationale:** vendoring (vs `require("@dietrichgebert/ponytail")`) keeps
  the Docker container air-gapped (no runtime npm fetch), removes the stock OpenCode
  adapter from the dependency tree (double-injection guard), and lets the wrapper
  plugin (`../ponytail-scoped.ts`) add agent-type-aware scoping that the upstream
  adapter does not support on OpenCode.

Re-vendor deliberately on upstream bumps: update `SKILL.md` from the new tag and
re-check `instructions.cjs` against the upstream instruction builder.

## pstack (`cursor/plugins`)

The following skills are vendored verbatim from the
[pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) collection by poteto.

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/cursor/plugins
- **Pinned commit:** `60c641e4fad674784b30abcf9f8915dea39df38d` (main, 2026-08-19)
- **License:** MIT (see full text below)
- **Files vendored:**
  - `../skills/unslop-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from `pstack/skills/unslop/SKILL.md`
  - `../skills/technical-writing-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from
    `pstack/skills/technical-writing/SKILL.md` (`unslop` sibling refs renamed)
  - `../skills/blast-radius-skill/SKILL.md` — verbatim from
    `pstack/skills/blast-radius/SKILL.md` (`how`/`why`/`arena` sibling refs
    neutralized — those skills are not vendored in this repo)

Re-vendor deliberately on upstream bumps: re-fetch from the new pinned commit and
re-apply only frontmatter + sibling-ref adaptations.
